# Asteroids_Blue
Project From Computer Graphics in Uni @Mercer Univercity

## About:
 A rebuild of the game Asteroids. Completed in 2016, all current updates are individual "improvements" for the sake of improvements. (also code shit).

### Credits:
 * Jonathan Oakes - Me, I did the asteroid class, odds and ends, and broke it plenty of times.
 * Braeden Brettin - The guy that explained my ideas better then I could. Also fixed what I broke
 * Ted Dorfeuille - The guy that did something think collisions
 * Chris Le - Maybe this guy did collitions and Ted did tesselations?
 * Emily Herron - She did stuff. like the scoreboard and things like that. probably more odds and ends.

### Dependencies:
 * FreeGlut3 - Yes I know this is old and needs improvements.
 * g++ - For compiling
 * Linux or Windows 10 w/ WSL - Will not run on windows without WSL.
